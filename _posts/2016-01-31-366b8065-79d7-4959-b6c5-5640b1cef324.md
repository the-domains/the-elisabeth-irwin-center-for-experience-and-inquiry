Welcome to the Center for Experience & Inquiry.

The Center supports people, programs and partnerships that amplify the mission of the Little Red School House & Elisabeth Irwin High School.

The Center is guided in its work by the simple premise that LREI is a community grounded in Creativity, Collaboration and Consequence.
